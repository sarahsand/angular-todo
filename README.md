# Introduction

Instructor: Justin James - https://digitaldrummerj.me/  
Student: Sarah Sand  
Purpose: This project was created during a session at Nebraska Code. The session was "Up and Running with Angular."

# How do I run this application? (for beginners)

Run "npm install" in the project directory; Run "ng serve"; Open http://localhost:4200; Then, log in as example@gmail.com with password of 123456

# How is this project structured?

The login, authorization, and signup components all use a template-driven form. The todo component uses a model-driven form. According to the course, model-driven is the recommended, much improved method. "Reactive forms allow you to define the form fields and validation in the component instead of the template."

# Enhancement Ideas

@angular/animations to animate the delete functionality, etc.  
Sort and group list items (e.g. deleted items)  
Store deleted items on a separate screen or gray them out

# Ng2ws

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.7. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
